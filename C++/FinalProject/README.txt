Maxit

The object in maxit is to get as many points as possible when the game ends. 
Two players can play against each other, or one against the computer AI.
You get points in the game by moving your marker to a space with a number in it. 
Each space will contain random numbers from -9 to 15.
The first player always move horizontally and the second player always move vertically. 
You move to the place that you want to go by using the arrow buttons.
The game ends after every space has been filled out.
The scoreboard will show at the bottom of the chart.

1 or 2 players?
